Just a demo project for my talk at Vue.js Meetup Vienna @ Tset.

You can use `devbox shell` to have all that is needed for BE and FE, or otherwise:

# Frontend
Make sure you have at least Node v20, pnpm ready, start with `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev`

# Backend
Make sure to have golang installed and start with `go run .` out of the /be folder
